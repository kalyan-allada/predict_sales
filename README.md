## Daily sales prediction of Rossmann Stores

This project deals with predicting 6 weeks of daily sales in advance for Rossmann drug stores located in Europe. The project is based on a kaggle competition. The description of the competition can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rossmann-store-sales). Store sales are influenced by many factors such as promotions, competition, school and state holidays, seasonality, and locality etc. The idea is to use these features and build a machine learning mode to predict sales in advance so that store managers can prepare and focus on what's most important to them.
